# What does a SyntaxError indicate? Try running the above code, then use the resulting error message to fix the error.
# Syntax Error indicates that the program cannot be understood by the Python interpreter.
# In this case, a colon needs to be added at the end of the conditional (current_speed > speed_limit)
