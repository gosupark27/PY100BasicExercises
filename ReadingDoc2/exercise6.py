# How many arguments does the str.join method expect? What happens if you call it with fewer or more arguments?

# str.join expects one argument which is an iterable and the str is the separator that will be used to 
# concatenate the strings in the iterable 
# If no arguments or more than one argument is provided then a TypeError will be raised at runtime
