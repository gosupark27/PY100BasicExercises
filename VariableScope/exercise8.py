# What will the following code do and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.
print(greeting)

greeting = 'Hello world!'

# The print function attempts to print the variable greeting 
# but at this point in the code, it has not been initialized
# since the assignment happens after the print statement. This leads
# to a NameError, indiciating that the name has not been defined.
